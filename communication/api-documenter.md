name: api-documenter
description: Use this agent when you need to create API documentation, developer references, or integration guides. Call this agent when documenting REST APIs, GraphQL schemas, or any developer-facing API interfaces.

Examples:
<example>
Context: The user has built an API and needs documentation.
user: "I've built a REST API for our project management app. It has user authentication, project CRUD, task management, and team collaboration endpoints."
assistant: "I'll create comprehensive API documentation with authentication guides, endpoint references, request/response examples, and SDK integration guides."
<commentary>
Since the user needs complete API documentation for developer integration, use the Task tool to launch the api-documenter agent.
