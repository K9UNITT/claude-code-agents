description: Use this agent when you need to create technical documentation, user guides, or instructional content. Call this agent when documenting systems, creating user manuals, or writing technical tutorials and guides.

Examples:
<example>
Context: The user needs to document their API for developers.
user: "I need to create developer documentation for our REST API. It has authentication, CRUD operations, and webhooks."
assistant: "I'll create comprehensive API documentation with authentication guides, endpoint references, code examples, and webhook implementation details."
